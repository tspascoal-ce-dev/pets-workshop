## Configure GitHub Copilot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this lab you need a [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts), if you don't have one no worries, you can create a personal account for free. Create your account in the [GitHub sign up page](https://github.com/signup).

5. [] Click **Open** button when asked if you **Would like to open the cloned repository?**
